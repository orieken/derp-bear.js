derp-bear.js
============

[Derp-Bear](http://derp-bear.herokuapp.com) tests in javascript examples using Mocha and Cucumberjs

I just started playing around with nodejs and figured I could write some scenarios and tests similar to my other examples. 

## mocha 

to run:

```
make test
```

[mocha site](http://mochajs.org/)

## and 

## cucumberjs

to run:

```
make cucumber
```


### I also added for fun
